      WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Maine may not exclude
      religious schools from a state tuition program, the latest decision by a
      conservative majority that has increasingly favored the role of religion
      in public life. <br />
      <br />
      The vote was 6 to 3, with the court’s three liberal justices in dissent.
      <br />
      <br />
      Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said the
      ruling did not require states to support religious education. But states
      that choose to subsidize private schools, he added, may not discriminate
      against religious ones. <br />
      <br />
      In separate dissents, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Stephen G.
      Breyer expressed dismay at the direction of the court in taking up matters
      of religion in the public sphere.
